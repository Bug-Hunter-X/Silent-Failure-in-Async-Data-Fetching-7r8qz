# Silent Failure in Dart Async Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in asynchronous data fetching in Dart. The provided code handles exceptions, but crucially does not rethrow them. This can lead to silent failures, making debugging and error handling more difficult.

## The Problem

The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote API. While it includes a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions, it doesn't rethrow the caught exception. This means that even if an error occurs (e.g., network issue, invalid API response), the program continues execution without explicitly signaling the failure.

## The Solution

The solution involves rethrowing the exception after logging it, allowing for proper error handling at higher levels in the call stack. This ensures that errors are not silently ignored and can be handled appropriately.
